# RL-Poker-Bot

A comprehensive repository implementing multiple reinforcement learning and game theory algorithms for Texas Hold'em poker, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP), and Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR).

## Introduction to Poker

Poker is a family of card games that combines elements of chance, psychology, and strategy. In this repository, we focus on **Texas Hold'em**, one of the most popular variants of poker.

### Basic Rules of Texas Hold'em

Texas Hold'em is a community card poker game where players share common cards to make their best five-card hand:

1. **Deal**: Each player receives two private cards (hole cards) face down
2. **Betting Rounds**: The game consists of four betting rounds:
   - **Pre-flop**: After receiving hole cards
   - **Flop**: After three community cards are dealt
   - **Turn**: After the fourth community card
   - **River**: After the fifth and final community card
3. **Actions**: Players can:
   - **Fold**: Give up the hand and forfeit any bets
   - **Call**: Match the current bet
   - **Raise**: Increase the bet
   - **Check**: Pass when no bet is required (only if no one has bet)
4. **Showdown**: Remaining players reveal their hands, and the best five-card combination wins the pot

### Why Poker is Challenging for AI

Poker presents unique challenges for artificial intelligence:

- **Imperfect Information**: Players cannot see opponents' cards, making it a partially observable game
- **Stochasticity**: The random dealing of cards introduces uncertainty
- **Strategic Complexity**: Optimal play requires balancing exploitation and exploration, bluffing, and reading opponents
- **Large State Space**: Even simplified versions have millions of possible game states
- **Multi-agent Dynamics**: Strategies must adapt to different opponent types

### Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Play

In game theory, a **Nash equilibrium** strategy is one where no player can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. In poker, finding Nash equilibrium strategies (also called GTO strategies) is computationally challenging but provides a robust baseline that cannot be exploited.

## Project Overview

This repository implements multiple approaches to learning optimal poker strategies:

1. **MCCFR (Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization)**: A game-theoretic approach that converges to Nash equilibrium strategies
2. **DQN (Deep Q-Network)**: A deep reinforcement learning method using value function approximation
3. **NFSP v2 (Neural Fictitious Self-Play with Reward Shaping)**: Enhanced NFSP with pot-aware reward shaping to address profitability issues and calling station behavior

## Algorithms

### 1. Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR)

**File**: `MCCFR.ipynb`

MCCFR is a sampling-based variant of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) that efficiently approximates Nash equilibrium strategies in large games.

**Key Features**:
- External sampling variant for computational efficiency
- Regret matching for strategy updates
- Information set abstraction for state representation
- Convergence to approximate Nash equilibrium
- Evaluation against baseline agents (Random, OddsAgentV21)

**Results**:
- Achieves 95.3% win rate against random agents
- Explores 25,000+ game nodes over 3,000 training iterations
- Demonstrates strong performance in Limit Hold'em

**Usage**:
```python
# Train MCCFR agent
mccfr_agent, eval_results, training_values = train_mccfr(
    iterations=3000,
    eval_every=100,
    eval_games=500,
    progress_every=10
)

# Save trained model
mccfr_agent.save_model('mccfr_model.pkl')
```

### 2. Deep Q-Network (DQN)

**File**: `DQN.ipynb`

DQN uses deep neural networks to approximate the Q-function, learning optimal action values through experience replay and target networks.

**Key Features**:
- Deep neural network for value function approximation
- Experience replay buffer
- Target network for stable learning
- Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy
- GPU acceleration support

**Usage**:
The notebook is designed for Google Colab with GPU support. Follow the setup instructions in the notebook.

### 3. Neural Fictitious Self-Play v2 (NFSP with Reward Shaping)

**File**: `NFSP - version 2.ipynb`

An enhanced version of NFSP that addresses the "calling station problem" through pot-aware reward shaping. This version is designed to improve the agent's ability to make profitable decisions by emphasizing pot-odds awareness.

**Key Features**:
- All features from standard NFSP
- **Pot-Aware Reward Shaping**: Addresses the problem where agents win many hands but lose money overall
- Enhanced reward structure that:
  - Provides bonuses for winning large pots
  - Applies stronger penalties for losing large pots
  - Encourages value betting in significant pots
  - Discourages calling station behavior
- Enhanced diagnostics for win/loss ratio analysis
- Action distribution tracking

**Key Improvements**:
- Addresses the "calling station" problem (high win rate but negative BB/100)
- Pot-size aware reward shaping with exponential scaling
- Tiered penalties based on pot size (small, medium, large, very large)
- Enhanced evaluation metrics including win/loss ratio diagnostics

**Usage**:
```python
# Install dependencies
!pip install -q rlcard torch numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy pandas eval7

# Run all cells in the notebook
# The reward shaper is automatically initialized with optimized parameters
```
